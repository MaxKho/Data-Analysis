The Harassment_Detection_and_Prevention file details a group project to design a data-driven tool to be used in VR spaces. Our team settled on designing a harassment detection and prevention tool, documenting its design in detail in the aforementioned file.

The tool_deployment_simulation file is the notebook that I used to simulate deployment of the harassment tool described above in a mock chat room as an individual project. 

The Tool_Deployment_Simulation_Report file reports the key findings of the deployment simulation, which I also wrote up individually.
